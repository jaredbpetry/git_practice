## Learning about branches

now i'm gonna create a branch (using GUI) that I will be using for the rest of the day

just hit new branch ... but it's still not tracking to an upstream branch (github)

now when I commit stuff, they go to the local repo branch 'new-branch'

so, to make a branch: (from GUI)

-   click 'new branch'

-   name it

-   save and push

-   deal with the merge on github
