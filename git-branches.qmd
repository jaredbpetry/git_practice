## Learning about branches

now i'm gonna create a branch (using GUI) that I will be using for the rest of the day

just hit new branch ... but it's still not tracking to an upstream branch (github)

now when I commit stuff, they go to the local repo branch 'new-branch'

```{r}
cool_code <- c(1,2,3)

```

wow i love github so fkn much

new branch aight here we go
